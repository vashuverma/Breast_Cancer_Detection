# Breast_Cancer_Detection
This repository contains a breast cancer detection model implemented using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of breast cancer samples and is capable of predicting whether a given sample is benign or malignant.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluating the model is a collection of breast cancer samples. Each sample consists of various attributes such as texture, radius, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. The dataset is labeled with the corresponding diagnosis, indicating whether the sample is benign or malignant.
The dataset is split into two parts: a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the model, while the test set is used to evaluate its performance.
1) ID number
2) Diagnosis (4 = malignant, 2 = benign)
3-32)
Ten real-valued features are computed for each cell nucleus:
	a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)
	b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)
	c) perimeter
	d) area
	e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)
	f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)
	g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)
	h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)
	i) symmetry 
	j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)
  
# Model Architecture
The breast cancer detection model is implemented using a supervised learning approach. It employs a classification algorithm to predict the diagnosis of a given breast cancer sample.

The model architecture consists of the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and perform any necessary transformations.
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected from the dataset to improve the model's performance and reduce computational complexity.
Model Training: The preprocessed dataset is used to train the classification model. Popular machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, or support vector machines can be used.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the test set to measure its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the model's performance and ability to detect breast cancer accurately.
Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen breast cancer samples.
